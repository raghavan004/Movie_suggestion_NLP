🎬 CineMatch: A TF-IDF Based Movie Recommendation System
CineMatch is a content-based movie recommendation system that leverages TF-IDF vectorization to analyze movie metadata (such as titles, genres, plot descriptions, etc.) and recommends similar movies based on cosine similarity scores. It integrates seamlessly with a backend SQL database, dynamically fetching and updating movie data.

🔍 What It Does
Fetches movie data from a structured SQL database.

Vectorizes textual features like genres, tags, or plot summaries using TF-IDF.

Calculates similarity scores between movies using cosine similarity.

Recommends top-N similar movies based on a user's selected title or description.

Lightweight and explainable, ideal for interpretable recommendation pipelines.

🧠 Core Technologies
TF-IDF Vectorization (from scikit-learn)

Cosine Similarity for scoring

SQL Database Integration (MySQL / SQLite / PostgreSQL)

Pandas + SQLAlchemy for data querying and manipulation

💡 Key Features
🔗 Database-Driven: Automatically reads and updates movie data from the connected SQL database.

🧠 Intelligent Matching: Understands semantic relevance using term frequency patterns.

🎯 Content-Based Filtering: No need for user ratings or collaborative signals.

📜 Explainable Recommendations: Transparent scoring makes it easy to explain why a movie is suggested.

⚡ Fast and Scalable: Lightweight enough for local use, scalable with database size.

⚙️ Example Workflow
User selects a movie like "Inception".

System fetches its metadata from the SQL database.

TF-IDF vector is generated for all movies.

Cosine similarity is computed between "Inception" and all others.

Top 5-10 most similar movies are returned.

🌐 Use Cases
Personalized movie browsing for streaming apps

Recommendation modules for movie rental services

AI-based movie discovery platforms

Classroom or educational tools for teaching NLP and databases
